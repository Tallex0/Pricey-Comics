# Comics: Childrenâ€™s Books or Luxury Artpieces?

Welcome to this dataset! I've compiled a list of the highest sold comic books released each year since 1938 (in USD) up to 2021. In this dataset, I investigated some of the highest valued comic books sold of all time from every year from 1938-2021, and seen just how much money people were paying for these things. DISCLAIMER: The data collected here is from my own personal research from the internet, and I've only seen the sales from stuff on the internet, and all data was recorded before 06/23/2023. Here are some things to note:
-Some comic book values are in a state of flux pricewise (like an artpiece or stock), so these may not be the most recent values later on down the road from 06/23/2023.
-Note that a comic book's value is dependent on a number of factors, including (but not limited to): grade/condition, scarcity, release year, significance of the issue, and most importantly of all: a buyer's willingness to pay for the issue.
-Note that some of these sales are unverified, as these can be scarce, but all comics gathered for this dataset are from CGC grading slabbed issues (none looked at were raw copies)
-Note that ComicBookRealm.com prices a CGC 9.8 copy of Action Comics #1 at $6,000,000, although it is unlikely that that high grade of a copy exists.

From my findings, I notice that most key comic books nowadays seem to have turned into just another luxury item for millionaires, like NFTs and rare artwork.

#DEFINITIONS
-First appearance: the first time a character or place has appeared in a comic book. Same for the __(x)th__ appearance.
-Origin: a character or place's origin story, e.g. backstory/history in world.
-Cameo: a brief, often 1 panel appearance of a character. Can sometimes preceed first appearances (but are usually not as valuable)
-Full appearance: the xth full appearance of a character/place. Different from first appearance, in that a character may have appeared in another issue before this one as a cameo.
-cover appearance: the xth time a character has appeared on the cover of a comic book (sometimes, characters make their debuts in comic books, but are not featured on the cover until later)
-Key issue: a comic book issue that features a higher level of significance than most (e.g. first appearance, origin, cameo, etc.)
-CGC grading scale: a type of grading scale that is used to grade the condition of a comic book. Comic books graded by CGC will be put into a plastic display "slab" that is used to showcase the comic in all of its glory, but is unable to be open or read. It is assigned a number, typically from 0.5 to 10. For example: a 9.8 is a Near Mint/Mint copy (nearly perfect), 9.6 is a notch below that, 9.4 is Near Mint (minor wear), 9.2 is lower Near Mint, etc. down to 0.5, which is Poor, and the comic has major defects (e.g. may only contain 2 pages, cover is missing, etc.) More rarely, (this is unlikely to happen, since a lot of comic books have slight wear and use), if a comic book is treated with extreme care and immediately sent into CGC for grading, it could receive a graded value of a 9.9 (Mint condition, which has only a very minor manufacturing defect but no handling defect) or in a very well deserved case, a 10 (Gem Mint, which is essentially a perfect comic book, with no evidence of manufacturing defects or handling defects.) 
-Raw copy: an ungraded comic, not slabbed. Less valuable typically than a graded comic
-Low Print Run: a comic with low print run means that there were not typically as many copies of that comic produced than normal, making it more rare than other standard release issues.
-Variant: a variant is a copy of a comic book with an alternate title, or other attribute different from the issue is a variant of. An alternate cover is one of the most common types of variants.
-1:x variant: a type of variant that is a ratio of how rare it is compared to other issues. For example, 1:2 variant means that 1 copy of the variant is produced for every 2 copies of the original comic, 1:5000 means 1 copy is produced for every 5,0000 copies of the original.
